# dotfiles
My dotfiles for Linux

## Setup
For setup, clone this repository in your home directory using `git clone https://github.com/ixhbinphoenix/dotfiles`.
Configure all dotfiles before running the setup script, as it will break stuff if not configured correctly
cd into the dotfiles directory and run `./setup.sh`. The setup script will ask you if you want to install Dependencies, backup all your dotfiles with a .predot suffix and symlink the new ones into the correct locations
