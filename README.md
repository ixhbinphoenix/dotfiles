# dotfiles
My dotfiles for Linux

## Requirements
To use all tools in my dotfiles, following programs are required:
- [onefetch](https://github.com/o2sh/onefetch)
- [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch)
- [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl)
- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

## Setup
For setup, clone this repository in your home directory using `git clone https://github.com/ixhbinphoenix/dotfiles`.
cd into the dotfiles directory and run `./setup.sh`. The setup script will backup all your dotfiles with a .predot suffix and symlink the new ones into the correct locations
